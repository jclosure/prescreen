The PreScreen is up top. I included the descriptions below. Let me know if you have any questions!
PreScreen Test:
Without using any built in date or time functions, write a function or method that accepts two mandatory arguments. The first argument is a string of the format "[H]H:MM {AM|PM}" and the second argument is an integer. Assume the integer is the number of minutes to add to the string. The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first argument. For example Add Minutes("9:13 AM", 10) would return "9:23 AM". The exercise isn't meant to be too hard. I just want to see how you code. Feel free to do it procedurally or in an object oriented way, whichever you prefer. Use Ruby. Write production quality code.
